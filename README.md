# RedRiver_MonsoonalDynamics

This repository contains the code and results used to generate Figures 5-8 and S1 of the following paper:

Quinn, J.D., Reed, P.M., Giuliani, M., Castelletti, A., Oyler, J.W., and Nicholas, R.E. (Accepted). Exploring how changing monsoonal dynamics and human pressures challenge multi-reservoir management for flood protection, hydropower production and agricultural water supply. doi: [10.1029/2018WR022743](https://doi.org/10.1029/2018WR022743)

Figure 1 is the same as Figure 2 from [Quinn et al. (2017)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017WR020524/full), and the code used to make it can be found in the following repository: https://github.com/julianneq/RedRiver_RivalFramings.

Figure 2 was made mannually in Adobe Illustrator.

Generating Figures 3-5, 7c & 7f and S2-S4 requires reading in governmental data on streamflow and demand in the basin. This data cannot be made public, and consequently the code and data for these figures is not provided in this repository. The code for the synthetic streamflow generator and monsoonal rescaling is available in the following repository, but using data for the Susquehanna River Basin: https://github.com/julianneq/Kirsch-Nowak_Streamflow_Generator. The code for the climate downscaling is available here: https://github.com/scrim-network/red_river.

The code used to generate all other figures can be found within the `PaperFigures` directory. All other directories contain modeling results read in by this code.
