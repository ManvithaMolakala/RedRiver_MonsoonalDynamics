# RedRiver_MonsoonalDynamics

This repository contains the code and results used to generate Figures 5-8 and S1 of the following paper:

Quinn, J.D., Reed, P.M., Giuliani, M., Castelletti, A., Oyler, J.W., and Nicholas, R.E. (In Review). Exploring how changing monsoonal dynamics and human pressures challenge multi-reservoir management of food-energy-water tradeoffs.

Figure 1 is the same as Figure 2 from [Quinn et al. (2017)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017WR020524/full), and the code used to make it can be found in the following repository: https://github.com/julianneq/RedRiver_RivalFramings

Generating Figures 2-4, 6c & 6f and S2-S4 requires reading in governmental data on streamflow and demand in the basin. This data cannot be made public, and consequently the code and data for these figures is not provided in this repository.

The code used to generate all other figures can be found within the `PaperFigures` directory. All other directories contain modeling results read in by this code.
